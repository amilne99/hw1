# hw1
This homework contains the website for a fictional business created by my girlfriend and me. The first page (named index) contains a title, description of the product, a picture of it's intended functionality, and links to the other 2 pages (about us and benefits).
The about us page provides pictures of my girlfriend and me as well as brief overviews of our careers. It also contains links to my social media pages in case people want to get in touch. Finally it contains links to the home page and benefits page at the bottom.
The benefits pags includes a list of benefits in bullet point format and a table to quantify some of the expected benefits. Finally, it also contains links to the other two pages at the bottom. 
All of the links between pages are relative links and therefore should work on any computer. All of the photos are contained within the hw1 folder and therefore should not have any issues.
Multiple headers, images, and links (anchors) are used along with a table, a list, and a paragraph (across the 3 pages) which should satisfy the homework requirements laid out on the KIEI-451 course website. 
Please reach out to me at andrew.milne@kellogg.northwestern.edu if there are any bugs with the website.
