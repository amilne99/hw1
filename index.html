    <h1>Welcome to Samdrew's Shop Map App!</h1>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>Our invention, in phase 0 of development, is a grocery store navigation app that converts a list of recipes to a shopping list and then the shopping list into a route of the destination grocery store based on the store layout. This route will provide customers the shortest route to pick up their items, leading to an improved customer experience.</p>
    <p>See below for an image demonstrating the intended functionality:</p>
